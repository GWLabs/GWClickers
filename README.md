# GWClickers

### Summary

Clickers are expensive and have minimal usability. Professors have a large learning curve in trying to program them for their class and students are stuck wasting money on outdated hardware or pricey apps. As an alternative, this project will tackle those challenges and work to provide an open-source clickers platform for GW classes. The goals of the project will be the following:

1. Create highly usable and learnable clicker platform for both students and instructors
2. Add features to fill the gaps in current technology
3. Maintain information privacy
4. Account for breaches in academic integrity
